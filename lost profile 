Project: intelligent_profile_recovery

Goal

Provide automated and intelligent recovery support for a user-owned GitHub profile by leveraging behavioral patterns, commit history, and AI-assisted communication.


---

Architecture Overview

Layer	Language	Tools/Frameworks	Purpose

Web Interface	Python	FastAPI + Jinja2 or Streamlit	UI to interact with the recovery engine
Intelligence Layer	Python	Scikit-learn, Transformers (HuggingFace), LangChain	Profile ownership validation and claim generation
GitHub Crawler	Rust	reqwest, scraper	Pulls public data from GitHub repos
Identity Pattern Engine	Rust	Custom logic	Matches behavioral patterns to user
Communication Bot	Python	smtplib, OpenAI API	Generates and sends formal recovery emails



---

Core Modules

1. GitHub Behavioral Extractor (Rust)

// Crawls and extracts commit messages, timestamps, branch usage
pub fn extract_behavior_profile(repo_url: &str) -> BehaviorProfile {
    // Use reqwest + scraper to gather commit data
    // Build feature vectors like:
    // - Commit frequency histogram
    // - Time-of-day activity
    // - Branch naming styles
    // - Language usage stats
}

2. ML Ownership Model (Python)

# Trains on your historical behavior (public repos, commit styles)
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

def train_ownership_model(commit_data, label):
    # feature vector: [hour_of_commit, message_length, language, ...]
    X, y = preprocess(commit_data, label)
    model = RandomForestClassifier().fit(X, y)
    return model

3. Recovery Claim Generator (Python)

from openai import OpenAI

def generate_recovery_letter(user_data, evidence):
    prompt = f"""
    Write a professional GitHub account recovery letter. Include the following:
    - Username: {user_data['username']}
    - Reason for loss: {user_data['reason']}
    - Behavioral proof: {evidence['patterns']}
    - Repo signatures: {evidence['repos']}
    """
    return OpenAI().chat(prompt)

UI Example (FastAPI + HTML)

Upload repos or input your known commit history

System analyzes and prepares:

AI-generated letter

Ownership behavior profile

Optional legal templates




---

Deployment

Rust modules compiled to CLI or as WebAssembly

Python runs backend + ML logic

Deployed via Docker or local setup



---

Next Steps

1. Confirm that you are the rightful owner of the account.


2. Share:

Username of the lost GitHub profile

Repositories or activity you authored

Access to any emails or credentials you may have used
